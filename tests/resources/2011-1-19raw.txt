January 12, 2011  5 of 18   WEDNESDAY, 2:00 PM, JANUARY 12, 2011  DUE TO LACK OF AN AGENDA THERE WAS NO MEETING     
January 12, 2011  6 of 18 Closed Caption File of Portland City Council Meeting   This file was produced through the closed captioning process for the televised City Council 
broadcast. Key:  ***** means unidentified speaker.  JANUARY 12, 2011  9:30 AM  [gavel pounding] Adams: Good morning and welcome to the portland city council.  Today is Wednesday, 9:30 a.m. session,   January 12th, 2011.  And before we gavel in the quorum, i'd like to make a special presentation, if you would please come forward.  Whereas, the city of Portland draws its strength 
from the diversity of cultures, traditions, and experiences of its employees.  And big brothers, big 
sister, columbia northwest is open and inclusive with their children, families and volunteers and 
whereas the city of Portland is fortunate to have employees who recognize the needs for positive 
interactions between our communities, youth, adults and big brothers, big sisters is creating one-to-one relationships between caring adults and youth.  And whereas the worth of such interaction has 
been documented as an effective strategy to reduce crime and the fear of crime, reduce the high 
school dropout rate and reduce the use of alcohol and illegal drugs by youth and reduce the 
overrepresentation of youth and especially minority youth in the criminal justice system.  And 
whereas big brothers big sisters represents a local organization that can facilitate increased 
involvement between the large potential cohort of adult volunteers employed by the city of Portland 
and whereas, big brothers, big sisters has extended an opportunity to the Portland police and all city 
employees for volunteer activities that their workforce may participate in to enhance their lives and 
the lives of youth in their communities and whereas during january, 2011, big brothers, big sisters 
will acknowledge these efforts publicly.  Now, therefore I, sam Adams, mayor aof the City of 
Portland, the city of roses do hereby proclaim january 2011 to be big brothers, big sisters month in 
conjunction with national mentoring month in Portland and encourage all residents to observe this 
month.  Congratulations.    Al Sigala:  Thank you, thank you mr.  Mayor, my name is al sigala, the vice president for big brothers, big sisters columbia northwest.  I'm still a little horse from the ducks' game.  They did a 
great job.  But I want to thank you in honor of all the mentors here in the Portland-vancouver area, 
our mission is to provide one-to-one relationships for our children most in need.  Those mentorships result in great children, children who are less likely to be involved, as you said, in criminal activity 
and drugs and alcohol.  It also leads them to become better citizens.  Big brothers, big sisters, concentrates in investing in our best resource, our most precious resource, and that is the human 
resource.  Thank you.    Chabre Vickers:  Thank you.  My name is chabre Vickers.  I'm the director of community relations and diversity and I just want to also thank the commission and mayor for helping to celebrate the 
10th annual national mentoring month here in Portland through the proclamation.  Thank you.    Adams: Thank you both very much.  Appreciate it.  Karla, can you please call the roll.  [roll call]   Adams: We'll begin with communications.  Can you please read item number 38.    Item 38. 
Adams: Go ahead and begin.    Joe Rastatter:  Ok.  Thanks.  Good morning, mayor and city commissioners.  Thanks for this opportunity.  My name is joe rastatter and reside in the hollywood district with my beloved wife, 
melinda.  We enjoy very much, by the way, having cesar chávez boulevard in our neighborhood.  
I'm a member st Francis of Assisi parish.  A member of unite here a local 8, my job is selling beer 
January 12, 2011  7 of 18 and peanuts at major league events in seattle.  I™m also the co-chair of jobs with justice faith labor committee.  Two events help to sustain my spirit this time of year.  The martin luther king day 
celebration at highland christian center this Monday and our jobs with justice annual faith labor 
breakfast set for march 1st please attend.  I was touched by the testimony of our war veterans last 
week to this body and I agree it's essential to provide substantial memorial.  My recently deceased 
father, robert, was an army sergeant who served directly under george patton and he's the person 
most responsible for my values.  Raised in an orphanage after his father was killed in an industrial 
accident, dad became the type of catholic most concerned with service to the poor.  He believes that 
I do that the growing disparate between the super-rich and everyone else is a national disgrace and I 
would add is sustained by a war on workers.  As a jobs with justice person, my dad believes that 
fighting for justice at the workplace was a great way to support the troops.  What happens at the 
local level is very important.  Portland development deals need to be evaluated for its justice 
contempt.  Do they lift up the poor or increase the disparate? Past deals with paul allen at rose 
quarter and with portland family entertainment at civic stadium, busted unions and workers lost 
ground.  Workers deserve to be treated fairly every where but especially at our public owned 
property.  Fair wages and just treatment of workers should be written in as part of the deal.  Easier 
said than done.  Watching and advocating for hundreds of hours over the last 10 years, here's two 
highlights.  One was when pge park employees were threatened to be fired by an interim owner if 
they talked to you, city council or me about the fair wage ordinance.  And number two, when I told 
an usher grandmother that ordinance was going to kick in again and raise her wages from $8.25 to 
$10 an hour, she cried.  The difference between $9 and $11 an hour for Portland workers is huge.  
The fair wage ordinance and we worked a lot on it, is flawed but it's important to struggling 
workers.  And it will take conscientiousness on your part to see it is implemented properly and 
include all workers it was intended.  If workers at civic stadium decide to organize an union, I say 
it's very important to see their efforts are treated fairly.  Please do what you can do to promote good 
jobs with justice in our community.  Thank you.    Adams: Thank you.  Sir.  Please read the title for communications item number 39. Item 39. 
Moore-Love: She's not coming.    Adams: Please read the title for communications item number 40.    Item 40. 
Moore-Love: She also is not coming.    Adams: Ok.  Moving to the consent agenda.  Can you please read the title for item number 47? Item 47. 
Adams:  Unless there's objection, i'll refer it back to my office.  No objection, so referred.  [gavel pounded] please read the title for item number 51, which I understand, unless there's objections, 
will be referred back to commissioner Fish's office.    Fish: 51?   Adams: Yep.  That's what I was told.   Fish:  That™s news to me.  If someone can tell me why.    Adams: I don™t know.  Then we won't refer it back -- I think it was at request of your office.   Fish:  Oh, that™s not news to me.  Adams: Can you please read the title?   Item 51. 
Adams: Unless there are objections, referred back to commissioner Fish's office.  There's a scribner's error on the agenda, on item 57, it should say office of government relations instead of 
office of government management.  Unless there's objections, the record will note that as a 
scribner's error and amend.  Please call the roll -- or, did anyone else wish to pull an item from the 
consent agenda? Please call the vote on the consent agenda. 
January 12, 2011  8 of 18 Consent Agenda roll. Fritz: I vote aye.  I want to note on item 45, accepting metro funds of over three-quarters of a 
million for recycling and waste reduction, requires a report and I would like the reports to be 
presented at council so that metro taxpayers learn how their dollars are used to reduce the waste and 
i'm particularly interested in the work done with large businesses.    Moore-Love: Fish.    Adams: She voted first? Ok.    Fish: Aye.  Saltzman: Aye.  Leonard: Aye.    Adams: Aye.  [gavel pounded] consent agenda is approved.  That takes us to the regular agenda.  Please read the item -- it was on a previous agenda.  Read item number -- emergency ordinance 56. 
Item 56.    Adams: Welcome.    Winston Sandino, Capitol Project Manager, Bureau of Transportation:  Good morning, mayor 
and city council.  My name is winston, i'm a project manager for the city of Portland.  Bureau of 
transportation.  The 102nd project is going to construct phase ii of the overall plan.  Face I was 
already constructed and this ordinance is going to give $2.4 million from federal funds to build 
phase ii.  There was a little error in the ordinance that we fixed, so -- but the project -- the overall 
project is going to be -- this year, we're going to start design and right away -- right-of-way and we're going to construct the project next year.  2012.    Adams: Any questions from council?   Fritz: The previous ordinance number 11 had an emergency clause in it and I don't see one in this 
ordinance.    Sandino:  No, it doesn't need it to be an emergency.    Fritz: Thank you.    
Adams: The second line has a star on it.    Fritz: The previous one was an emergency, but this one -- that's why I was asking the questions.  And when we did it as item 11, it had an emergency clause at the end but this one doesn't.    Adams: Ok.  All right.  Any additional discussion from council? Does anyone wish to testify on item number 56? We will note for the record, there's an additional scribner's error to remove the 
emergency asterisk.    Moore-Love: A substitute -- a substitute ordinance.    Fish: So moved. Adams: The substitute is moved.  Is there a second?   Fritz: Second?   Adams: Can you please call the vote on the substitution. Item 56.    Fritz: Aye.  Fish: Aye.  Saltzman: Aye.  Leonard: Aye.    Adams: Aye.  [gavel pounded] substitution has been accepted and moves on to a second reading next week as a non-emergency.  Please read the title for report item number 57. Item 57.    Adams: The federal agenda ensures that the city's advocacy to the federal is focused on the vital issues to Portland.  As such, in this package, which has been developed in cooperation with all the 
bureaus, with members.  The council staff, with councilors themselves, it includes requests for new 
transportation investments that emphasize safety and freight mobility.  Leading on the cutting edge 
of innovation and sustainability with projects like the Oregon sustainability center and keeping our 
community safe through a multitude of issues preserving affordable housing in Portland and across 
the state.  I'm pleased it also includes new projects and partnerships in east Portland, including the 
creation of the east Portland gateway education center.  In doing so I i know I join with my council 
colleagues in thanking the congressional delegation and hardworking staff for their work and also 
January 12, 2011  9 of 18 consulting with us on this group of priorities.  And thank them for their ongoing work.  With that, i'd like to introduce martha pellegrino.    Martha Pellegrino, Director of Government Relations, Government Relations:  Thank you for the opportunity to bring to you the 2011 federal agenda.  As the mayor mentioned, there are a broad array of issues represented in this agenda.  Structural, it is divided into appropriations requests.  
And then policy and other project priorities.  I want to just identify that this report is a substitute 
from what we filed.  There were two substantive changes I want to point out to you.  One is the 
appropriations request, the first request on page 1 for the Oregon sustainability center.  The request 
that has been substituted is focused on the -- that is substituted is focused on the development of the 
training facilities which is different from what you saw before you which was water and wastewater.  The second change is one of the pdx design forum has been omitted because we've 
been working with our partners at the university of Oregon who will be the lead on that project.  
We'll be supportive you but the u of o will submit that to the federal delegation.  I'd like to thank my 
newest staff member, nils, and thank vickie cram, the lobbyist unable to be here today, but also gave a lot of advice and guidance and lastly, I would like to thank members of your staff and the 
bureaus' staffs and each of you for your input in helping to build this agenda.    Adams: Questions from council?   Fish: I have a question.  And first, martha, thank you and your team for the collaborative way you've pulled together this agenda.  Can you remind us how world has changed with the change in 
leadership in the house and how that can impact requests that we have pending for earmarks?   Pellegrino:  Sure, a couple of -- let me take that in a couple of parts, commissioner.  First, the republicans have taken over the majority -- or, majority of the house of representatives.  Whereas, 
democrats are maintaining a slim majority in the senate.  What that means with regard to earmarks 
is if -- there's still an open question whether there will be earmarks this coming session.  The house 
has adopted a -- has resolved not to pass any bills including earmarks, although there's been 
substantive discussions about what is an earmark.  So that may still have yet to be determined.  On 
the senate side, senate democrats have not yet adopted a ban on earmarks.  So the possibility and 
the city's opportunity for potentially submitting projects this cycle will rest before u.s. Senators and 
we've been told by staff to go ahead and develop projects and they will certainly let us know if 
there's changes to that.    Fish: Thank you.    Adams: Any other discussion from council? I move the substitution.    Fish: Second.    Adams: Moved and seconded.  Any discussion on the motion? Anyone wish to testify on the motion? Karla, please call the vote on the motion. 
Amendment substitute report 57 roll.   Fritz: Aye.    Fish: Thanks again, martha and your team.  Aye.    Saltzman: Thank you very much, aye.    Leonard: Aye.    Adams: Aye.  [gavel pounded] does anyone wish to -- the substitution has been approved, as the basis of further -- the substitution has been approved.  Anyone wish to testify on item number 57? Karla, please call the vote on item number 57. Item 57 roll.    Fritz: Thanks for the government relations staff and the office of neighborhood involvement for assisting the mayor and me with the public involvement in this agenda.  We appreciate the fact that citizens have been involved and knowledgeable about what's going on and then we can help them 
with our lobbying training coming up on january 18th to learn how to continue to participate with us and thanks to vickie in Washington d.c.  For many years of successful of service and thanks to 
January 12, 2011  10 of 18 our congressional elected delegation.  The shooting in arizona last week shows their job is not only difficult in terms of policies, and service.  Aye.    Fish: This is an ambitious agenda in tough times and I want to call out one initiative that the housing bureau supports.  To tap residual receipts in expiring use properties.  Ate time when it's unlikely we get increased appropriation for housing this is a common sense approach that allows us 
to tap money approved within certain development and use it for the acquisition for rehabilitation of 
housing that's affordable to older adults and people with disabilities and low income.  We hope we 
can continue to have the approach of the common sense agenda of putting money into our 
affordable housing.  Aye.    Saltzman: Aye.  Leonard: Aye.    Adams: I want to thank martha and her team and a look to nils and look forward to working and traveling back to the east coast to engage good our begging for money responsibilities from the 
federal government.  It's great to work with you all.  Aye.  The federal legislative agenda is 
approved.  [gavel pounded] please read the item, emergency ordinance, item number 58. Item 58.  Adams: Welcome.  What are we looking at.    Christine Moody, Purchasing Manager, Bureau of Purchases:  Good morning, mayor.  Christine moody, procurement services.  Today you have before you an ordinance to authorize a 
contract with central parking systems for parking garage management services.  In september 2010, 
an rfp was issued and proposals received from ace parking and star park and central parks systems and evaluated about I a four-person selection committee.  Two downtown business representatives 
and one parking garage expert and one pbot employee.  Received 355 points out of a possible 400.  This contract will be funded by receipts from the six parking garages.  Net revenue to the city will 
be based on actual revenue minus operating sentences and management fees which can fluctuate on 
the usage of the garages.  The gross revenues are anticipated to be $66 million over the five-year 
contract term and operational expenses budgeted at $9,700,000 and management fees costs are 
budgeted at $970,000 with net revenue projected at a55 -- at $55 million over the five-year contract 
term.  With an option to renew for years four and five.  For the city to be able to evaluate the 
contractor's performance during the initial three-year term term.  If it there are concerns, we let the 
contract automatically terminate.  Central parks system has enter nods a equity partnership with a 
local organization.  The independent development surprise appliance and has a subcontractor requirement.  For purposes of this contract.  I'll turn this over to ron to talk about the specifics of 
this contract.    Ron Geason, Sr. Business Operations Manager, Bureau of Transportation:  Good morning, mayor and council, it is my first time here and i'm happy to be in this chair, at least for now.  
Parking garage management in the city has been unable for the last several years because of our 
search for appropriate management and my comments will be brief and be related to what I believe 
are your specific concerns.  And that is, we are seeking a stable solution to parking garage 
management here that will last three years, five years, perhaps 10 years and I think we've laid in 
place this proposal and other things to make that happen.  Outsourcing is a great way for the city 
and others to get expertise that we couldn't possibly produce on our own.  We have run a very 
rigorous rfp process this time around.  And I think staff have done a great job in doing this.  Heavy 
citizen involvement.  Heavy involvement from the business community, diversity community.  And 
I think it really is -- I think it really is solid.  There are other things going on that I think will make 
things stable and that is, we're committing within our budget to fund $1 million of improvements in 
technology.  For the parking garages.  We are seeking a new parking garage manager.  That search 
is underway.  As part of this contract, we have heavy reporting requirements, monthly reports, annual reports, and annual audits.  We have an external consultant with us who will help us with 
management reports and oversight and so I am confident that we're on the right track in terms of 
January 12, 2011  11 of 18 this proposal.  And sometimes ago, you had the wisdom, I think, to transfer this function to pbot, where it belongs and that provides a good base of support.  Second of all, I want to emphasize the 
importance of the revenue know out of parking garages to pbot and to the city.this is about a $10 
million operation.  And revenue goes first and foremost for operating expenses.  It goes to provide 
any maintenance, any improvements in the garages.  Funds are used for general transportation 
revenue support.  Used to support bond issues in the garages and more broadly, and it is, in fact, just 
a really key revenue support for pbot and central parking has shown a record of innovation.  Of 
being sensitive to management concerns, low cost and we're delighted to partner with them.  
Thirdly, I wanted to address the impact on employment.  I think whenever you introduce 
technology, there's the potential for displacement of employees and that occurs to some extent in 
this proposal.  We're sensitive to it, central parking is sensitive to it and we're committed to working 
with star park to try and retain employees to the greatest extent we can in higher level jobs than they 
have currently.  Looking to move from a set of cashiers no longer needed to ambassadors, to 
maintenance staff, and one of the things that impressed me about this proposal was central parking 
was the only one coming forward saying we will have a person in the garages 24/7 to respond to 
citizen concerns.  So there's a nice combination of technology, but a human touch in the garages as 
well.  This proposal is very strong in terms of working with idea and other -- others in the 
community, so they're very strong with joint ventures.  With folks in this community.  And so we 
encourage your endorsement.  We're open to revisiting and making reports to council as necessary 
to keep this on track.  I think the idea of having a three-year agreement that allows for some 
negotiation with expansions to year four and five allows us to really keep on track of this.  But 
we're set I think to remove the instability and put in place a system that will really work for us.    Adams: Discussion with council? Saltzman: I have a question --   Fritz: Thank you.  I appreciate the mayor taking time to allow rebidding on this contract with a 
revised request for proposals.  Since there was controversy in the previous proposal, can you tell me 
who the four evaluators were?  You said their jobs but I don't see them listed who they are.    Saltzman: Listed under citizen participation.    Fritz: Who reviewed their requests for proposals but doesn't say the four people.    Moody:  It was michael jacob, the former parking garage manager for the city of vancouver.  
William palmer, a downtown businessman, james rickman, a owner of an cpa firm, and james louie, 
a downtown restaurant owner.  And mr.  Louie, helped with the written proposals but he had other 
obligations so he did not sit on the oral interviews.  And don gardner, a consulting engineer and he's 
a retired transportation employee.    Fritz: The same as the rfp evaluation committee?   Geason:  Correct.    Moody:  That's the evaluation committee.    Adams: William is the president of the downtown retail council.    Fritz: Just as a side note I think we should have some discussion on having a woman on each of the 
committees -- that's an aside.  You mentioned the contract provides for three years with a two-year 
extension.  Will that decision be made at council after three years? Adams: No, that™s a -   Geason:  My understanding is that procurement has the authority to expand the contract for years four and five.    
Fritz: And what are the standards for deciding whether or not they've done a good job?   Geason:  The rfp that central responded to, as well as the contract has a whole set of benchmarks and criteria within it and the annual audits will be -- will be related to whether or not they're satisfying those key criteria.    
January 12, 2011  12 of 18 Fritz: I would like to get copies of those annual audits, and in particular, a report annually after the first year how well they've done on retaining employees and i'm glad to hear there's going to be 24/7 
in-person participation in the garages.  That relieves some of my concerns.  How is the revenue 
expected to increase in what are the reasons for projected increase in revenue?   Geason: In this business, the human touch in terms of cashiers, often creates issues and concerns and loss of revenue.  It's the nature of the business.through the use of technology here, with -- with 
kiosks and automated systems, that really just tends to decline.  I think that the work of central with 
the business community validation programs and so on will increase revenue and I think we'll be 
operating much more efficiently.    Fritz: So the projection is for --   Adams: If I can add on to that.  The greater sales effort to businesses, to sign up for validation, means more uses of the garage, so aggressive sales pitch to businesses has the opportunity in increasing the -- increasing the validation program has the opportunity to bring in more revenue.    Fritz: And --   Geason:  And the cost in the garage will be done with the use of technology.    Fritz: We're not projecting to increase the parking fees?   Geason:  Not at this time.    Fritz: The projection is for $11 million a year in revenue.  How much do we currently get?   Geason: $10 million.    Fritz: About an million increase.  Thank you.  We have had a discussion when reviewing the handy capped permits, but the possibility of allowing the use of handy capped spaces to be used without 
cost to free up more spaces on the street.  Can this be part of the ongoing assignment to this 
contract?   Geason:  I can tell you that that conversation is ongoing.  And there are relationships between how handicapped parking is treated in the garages and how it's treated on the street that we want to make 
sure that's thoroughly considered.    Fritz: How do you cooperate overall parking strategy? What's the mechanism with pbot who needs 
to look at revenue on the streets as well as the garages, how will this be cooperated.    Adams: This pre-dates you're being in your position, your question is what exactly?   Fritz: The city needs to maximize revenue from parking meters on the street, which currently in 
any space other than a 15-minute space, someone with a handicap sticker can park without charge.  
We had a discussion about better utilizing the spaces within the garages which are accessible and 
have elevators and probably more comfortable than on the street parking but obviously would decrease the revenues in the garages while it increases the revenues on the street.  We, as a city, and 
the council, need to make sure we maximize both customer service and revenue and how is that 
going to happen in between -- between this contract and pbot management?   Adams: The advice we've sought from the disabled community is mixed on whether they like street or garages.  I would say mixed at best.  Right now, our subsidy, based on that is about a million dollars a year.  So the discussion of it in the garages, I guess the answer to your question is probably 
best had as part of the budget process because it's foregoing revenue either on the street -- a stall on 
the street or in the garages.    Fritz: My question is how more cooperation at the city's parking strategy.  The money, for sure, but 
also that question of who gets to decide how those handicapped spots and what's the mechanism for 
interaction between pbot and the contractee?   Adams: Well, I mean, we're allowed to make amendments to this contract -- those kind of amendments to this contract, moving forward --   Fritz: Is there any kind of committee or point person?   Adams: We've had a -- our can he committee worked when we looked at the on-street spots, did not look at the garages.  So i'm happy with the status quo right now.  In passing this.  I think further 
January 12, 2011  13 of 18 discussions in the budget process is probably a good time to have that and ask the budget committee, which also obviously looked at operational issues for pbot to maybe take a look at that.    Fritz: If we decided we wanted to have that happen, does this contract allow us to tell the 
contractee what is what we want to have happen.    Adams:  Yes.    Fritz: Thank you.    Adams: At our cost, not theirs.  Right.    Saltzman: A couple of questions explained to me -- the automation would be complete.    Geason:  Each parking garage will have an automated in and out, no cashier at the entrance or exit.    Saltzman: How do you pay by cash.    Geason:  The kiosks have the capability to deal with cash and change.  There's also tv monitors at each entrance and exit so that you have the capacity to reach a human being, at least remotely, 
through the television system, to respond to your concerns and there are brought angle cameras at 
each location so that we can secure information in terms of license plate numbers and i.d.s and so 
on.  And failing that, there is a human available 24/7 to assist.    Adams: The notion here is to be visible, not only on the entrance, but on the floors, as well as, and the structures.  So that we -- we have a good deterrent against crime.    Saltzman: So the remote terminal -- i'm going out the garage, what do I encounter first? A kiosk and then the remote terminal or -- are they all one unit?   Geason:  Well, I may want to have central parking weigh in on this so that I don't confuse you, but I believe you deal with a kiosk first and tv help second and human support third.    Adams: You pay as you enter or leave.    Saltzman: As you leave, so if i'm having trouble at the kiosks, i'm able to pull forward and talk to a remote terminal or impeded by a gate I have to get through first.  That's a detail -- I do worry about 
coups in the garages -- queues in the garages as a deterrent for people wanting to park and there's no 
human around, although there's somebody in the building, people get frustrated quickly.    Adams: Introduce yourself.    Jerry Skillete:  Jerry, central parking.  To answer question, there are kiosks in every facility by the 
elevator corresponds of the main entrance and pedestrian areas and everyone is encouraged to pay 
at the kiosk, however, if they get into a lane, they can pay in the lane as well.    Saltzman: I guess that's what i'm referring to.  The pay in lane experience.    Skillete:  Yeah.    Saltzman: You encounter a place where you enter a validated ticket or cash, and if something is not right, where's the video terminal?   Skillete:  Right there.  And every single lane, entry, exit, and every paying kiosk, there's direct communication at all times.  Not only do you have a human touch, but you've got people in the facility, roving in the facility, but you have instant access, really, to someone to help you from 
every single terminal, every entrance and exit.    Saltzman: Will those cameras you have, they'll also know what the queue is behind?   Skillete:  They do.  They're wide angle, particularly on the exits and entrances.  One of the things you like to see if there's a queue, if there's something -- if there's three or four cars in a lane, or if it's 
very busy.  Those kind of things.  And so the way we've done our camera locations, we have a 
broad view and then we actually have the ability of seeing all the way down to a validation or credit 
card.  For instance, even if someone puts their credit card in upside down, we would know that.  We 
could see that.    Fish: Can I ask a piggy-backed question off that.    Saltzman: Sure.    
January 12, 2011  14 of 18 Fish: What i've noticed that people in vehicles that are a little too big for the garage but technically, like a pickup truck with a certain length will park in a place that makes it difficult to navigate through the parking structure.  What we typically do now, if that happens, you go down and tell 
someone that's operating the station, there's a problem and they address that.  How would you 
address that in the future?   Skillete:  At every kiosk and every lane, there's direct communication.  So it would be at the kiosk.  If you actually pushed a button, you would have access immediately to someone to talk to, and we 
can dispatch understanding this case, don't forget there's cleaning people and there's security in 
every facility.  So we'd have the ability to dispatch security at this point.    Adams: Just to be -- it took a while for me to get the details of this.  When you push the button to talk to somebody, there will be somebody available 24 hours a day on the other end of the button 
speaker, right?   Skillete:  Yes.    Adams: And they in turn -- and that's important in case you've got someone working in the facility, already helping somebody else.  It wouldn't be the case where you wouldn't get another person at 
the end of the speaker because they're separate and the dispatch of that happens and they're able to 
trouble shoot in terms of something goes way wrong, you can trouble shoot employees amongst the 
garages to help out if needed?   Skillete:  We've got protocol, for instance, the way the system works is we actually use nextel cellular technology and the protocols go to the employees in the facility first, security second, and 
our supervisors as well.  So those protocols work very quickly.    Saltzman: Are your employees available remotely? Empowered to make a decision, ok.  This person is causing too much.  A queue?   Skillete:  Absolutely.  You have to because what can happen, and again, one of the cash control aspects of this that's so good is, again, the recording of any kind of transaction like that where we 
have to let someone go, raise the gate remotely because of a traffic concern.  So you've got a 
decision being made from that basis where no one's actually handling cash at that point and that's documented back to the city.    Saltzman: But they're empowered to say, "raise the gate"?   Skillete:  They are.    Saltzman: A couple more questions directed at city folks.  Talk about the job loss.  I don't know how many employees are by star park.    Geason:  Looking at the hours worked, there's currently 40 fte in the parking garages and that number over the five year period goes down to 28, a 12 fte reduction and this is primarily due to the technology and not having cashiers at each place.  We are --   Saltzman: And there's a commitment -- I guess by central and the city for those 12 fte that --   Geason:  We are -- we're sensitive to the issue of employment.  Central is committed to working with these folks it try and retain star park employees to the greatest extent possible and we have 
control over how fast we go in technology to ease this transition and make it as soft as we can.    Saltzman: My final question, you were coy about when we asked about the parking rates.  We're not projecting a increase now.    Adams: There's nothing in this contract that inherently -- to meet the projections, inherently, to -- to require us to raise rates to meet the financial projections.  As we look at all parking rates downtown 
and the reason we moved this to transportation is so that there would be sort of -- council could 
consider and we could manage among other things, the financial forecasts together on street and 
garage.  So this contract, you know, has extensions and I think the coyness is that who knows what 
will happen in five years, but it won't be because of anything inherent in this contract.  We decide to raise rates, we'll raise -- we can raise rates.    
January 12, 2011  15 of 18 Saltzman: I guess I just want to express that my desire that we not raise rates and -- at least in this three-year interim period.  We're netting $10 million a year, i'm not sure why we would want to raise -- when we want people to shop downtown and that's a challenge as anyone who shopped over 
the holiday season may see.  I think downtown still is at a very, very --   Adams: It's done quite well this past holiday season.    Saltzman: Relative to? Adams: Because of the rates we raised at the request of business community went to marketing.  We have no plans on raising in the next three years, but depends on how long the recession goes.  I appreciate your comment.  Anything more?   Saltzman: Will rate increases come to us?   Adams: They always come to us.    Saltzman: Thank you.    Fish: I appreciate the exchange we have with your office and with kyle for clarifications.  I want to follow up on something that commissioner Fritz raise.  Which is the term of the contract and 
council's role in the renewal and thanks to what you furnished to us, it's clear that you™re asking for 
our approval today to interpret in a contract which has an initial three-year term.  Years four and 
five are subject to a decision that this operator is doing a good job and can be extended and if it 
goes beyond years five, years five to 10 would be subject to council approval, correct.    Moody:  Correct.    Fish: We approved years one through three.  And pbot in connection with you, four and five, and council would have to approve anything beyond five, is that correct?   Moody:  That's correct.  The ordinance you have before you is council is authorizing the five-year agreement right now.  The contract term is written for the initial three years, with the option for us 
to renew years four and five.    Fish: As I read -- because it said the initial term is for three years, I just assumed it was going to come back to us at three years and we would then get the benefit of your evaluation, whether they 
were performing and whether it should be renewed and I guess now I understand that the intent was 
five years.  Mayor, rather than propose it come back to us after three years, what i'd like to propose 
through legislative history, the council get 90 days notice of any intent to renew beyond that.  So 
that we'd have an opportunity.  Adams: Absolutely.   Saltzman: One question: These jobs are subject to the city's fair wage ordinance, is that correct?   Moody:  The security and janitorial, yes.    
Saltzman: Thanks.    Fish:  To clarify.    Adams: Status quo on that.  Fish:  If you determine after evaluating and there's --   Fish: There's a lot of accountability built into this with the annual audit.  If you determine if year three, it should be renewed one year or two additional years, we get 90-day notice in case council wanted to weigh in on it.    Moody:  And we have a discussion that pbot can come back and do a report to council at the 90-day 
notice if that's something --   Fish: I'm not proposing we proscribe that.  If council receives notice, if they have issues they can ask for a hearing on that.  Thank you.    Fritz: And the 12 ftes projected to be lost, those are all cashiers?   Skillete:  Yes, they are.    Fritz: The level of in-building security remain the same?   Skillete:  Yes.    Fritz: Thank you.    
January 12, 2011  16 of 18 Adams: Any other discussion from council? All right.  Anyone wish to testify? Thank you for your testimony.    Moore-Love: No one signed up.    Adams: Anyone wish to testify on this matter? All right.  Karla, please call the vote. Item 58 roll.    Fritz: I appreciate the staff and mayor taking another run at this contract and making sure that the process is transparent and clear.  I share the concerns about job retention and review, so i'm glad my 
colleagues have proposed some reporting on that.  And i'm encouraged that there will be good 
financial management and that the city is -- can expect to see an increased parking revenue through 
the efforts of central and the partnership with the folks in Portland.  Aye.    Fish: Aye.    Saltzman: Well, I want to welcome central to our city garages, and I look forward to a good relationship and I hope you will find jobs for those 12 ftes projected to be lost.  Many of those people are minorities.  And women.  And it's important to me that they be -- have opportunities 
within the central organization.  So i'll be watching that closely.  I also want to thank star park for the four or five years they've managed the garages for us and welcome to central.  Aye.    Leonard: I think this action today signifies that a dramatic shift in how the city has handled managing parking contracts.  This is the second contract i've been involved in since i've been on 
council, both of them have been controversial and had some time to renew them.  I was part of 
those on council who wanted to make sure in the final analysis when we awarded the contract 
nobody could accuse of us of being unfair.  I appreciate mayor Adams having another run at the 
port of Portland process and evaluating it fairly.  Having said that, the initial briefing I received 
from the winners of contract, can tell today, i've been impressed with the new approach they intend 
to take which I think the council needs to hopefully fully appreciate that increases the city's 
revenues and increases the city's opportunities for lost revenue or misplaced revenue and I think 
brings a very professional approach to the garages that we've yet to see to this date.  So i'm very 
pleased and recognize the work that sam has done to make sure that this happens and I hope 
Portlanders appreciate that we're running these much like a business would run their operations and 
we will be the benefit as Portland taxpayers as a result.  Aye.    Adams: Thanks to staff for your work on this.  Appreciate it very much.  Aye.  [gavel pounded] , can you please read the title for second -- and call the voting second read, item number 59. Item 59 roll.    Fritz: Thank you, to all of staff who worked so diligently on this and indeed, the citizen input on this.  I do note -- I think there's a scribner's error in a couple of places in the code language where it 
refers to the administrator or his designee.  I don't think we need the "his designee." I think it should 
be gender neutral.  The attorney is saying yeah, we do.  The most compelling testimony I heard was 
the humane society, an equine protection specialist and supports the balanced approach that 
addresses the well being of horses.  I'm not an expert in horses and so I greatly appreciated his 
advice.  I think that they can be part of a vibrant downtown and a wonderful business opportunity and I -- therefore, support these very reasonable protections and thanks again to staff.  Aye.    Fish: Aye.    Saltzman: I also want to thank the staff who I think worked very hard to arrive at some fair and balanced regulations here that I think strike the right balance, I guess, is what I want to say.  The -- I 
don't want to say fair and balanced.  Strike the right balance between those who were suggesting we 
totally ban horse-drawn carriages in the city versus those probably who were happy with the status 
quo.  I think it's important to provide the necessary temperature regulations and other regulations 
that are part of this ordinance, I think those really are not too onerous, I explored that a lot last 
week.  They don't seem onerous and I think they will provide better working conditions for the 
January 12, 2011  17 of 18 horses and provide character to the city.  And so we should keep them.  But under the more humane conditions that will be achieved under these regulations.  So thank you and pleased to vote Aye.    Leonard: Aye.    Adams: Well, I want to thank staff who have worked on this.  It's -- I agree, you know, just common sense, fair compassion that allows for the growth of the industry and which I agree as to the sort of ambiance of downtown.  Thank you very much.  Aye.  [gavel pounded] so approved.  
Can you please read the title and call the vote for item number 60, second reading. Item 60 roll.    Fritz: Hard to get used to the new order, it is for me.  As we've discussed last week, this is authorizing previously planned spending and the borrowing for such and the process that provide 
the public to provide comment.  February 16th from 2:00 to 4:00 in the Portland building is the next 
meeting and the public is welcomed to weigh in on these throughout the budget process.    Fish: Aye.  Leonard: Aye.  Saltzman: Aye.    Adams: Aye 60 is approved.  [gavel pounded] please read the title for emergency ordinance number 61. Item 61.    Adams: Commissioner Fritz. Fritz: thank you, mayor.  I'm pleased to bring before council an audit settlement with mci metro 
negotiated by our office of cable communication and franchise management in cooperation with the 
city attorney's office, it was based on a well-done audit pursuant to an ongoing successful 
interagency agreement with cable.  Settlement will bring an payment of nearly a quarter of a million 
dollars.  $237,962.15.  That's into the general fund.  This is new, unanticipated one of had time 
money.  The settlement will add approximately $10,000 a year to mci metro ongoing payments to 
the city.  $122,000 a year.  None of this would be possible without the ongoing excellent work of 
dedicated cable office staff who carry out an ongoing schedule of audits for all you have our utility franchisees and consistently enforcing existing code and franchise provisions to maximize revenue 
for the city.  Also, our cable staff and tim, in my office, skip in the mayor's office and brandon in 
commissioner Saltzman's office are working together with citizens to bring a citywide strategic plan later this year.  This is an example of the other work that the cable office does.  It's an exciting and 
channeling time.  I'm happy to bring this ordinance how our hard work is paying off for the citizens. 
 David olson, the director of the office of cable and franchise management is here to respond to 
council questions.  David?   David Olson:  Thank you, mayor, commissioner Fritz, council members.  I would like to introduce you to our new utility program manager, Jennifer lee, the successor to dave solos in managing the 
program and we're beyond thrilled she's here and she'll be our chief staff person for utility program, 
franchise, audit issues and, of course, the ever-popular wireless issues.  So --   Adams: How many contracts or agreements do you monitor?   Olson:  About three dozen.  And that in addition to the license fee program, which is a tax program.  So the universe of payers is larger, franchises involving street uses is a smaller set.    Adams: What's the number of non-duplicated categories that your office oversees?   Olson:  All categories of payors.  Mayor, that would probably be more than 400, I would say.  400 to 500, if we count all payors under the license tax and franchising process.    Adams: Thank you.  Any other discussion?   Saltzman: What was the amount?   Fritz: $237,962.15.    Adams:  All right.  This is an emergency ordinance, anyone wish to testify on item number 61?   Moore-Love:  No one signed up.    Adams: Please call the vote on item 61. Item 61 roll.    
January 12, 2011  18 of 18 Fritz: Thank you, mayor, for giving me this assignment a little over two years ago.  It's fascinating.  Thank you to all the staff in the cable office.  Nine people bringing in this amazing amount of 
revenue.  Over $72 million that goes in the general fund and available for good uses for the city of 
Portland and the citizen of Portland.  We appreciate your diligence and it's especially helpful to 
have this additional money as we look to the budget next year.  Aye.    Fish: Congratulations, commissioner Fritz, david and your team at the bureau.  Pleased to vote aye.    
Saltzman: Good work and welcome, ms.  Lee, to the job and well done.  Aye.    Leonard: Thank you, mandate a, for doing such a good job, overseeing this office.  It was one.  My first assignments and I enjoyed it as well.  Aye.    Adams: Congratulations, commissioner Fritz.  David and the entire team.  Welcome aboard.  Aye.  [gavel pounded] all right.  61 is approved.  That gets us to the end of our agenda for the week.  So we stand adjourned.  [gavel pounded]   
 
At 10:31 a.m. Council adjourned.
