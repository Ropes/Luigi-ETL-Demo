Lebowski ipsum jesus, you mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie. What's a pederast, Walter? Sure. That and a pair of testicles. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous. I like your style, Dude. Okay, Jackie, done. I like the way you do business. Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure.

But that is up to little Larry here. Isn't it, Larry? Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole! I'll suck your cock for a thousand bucks. Who's in pyjamas, Walter? Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate. Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American. Please. They finally did it. They killed my fucking car.

Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust. Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh—you know?

Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry? Strong men also cry… Strong men also cry. Mein nommen iss Karl. Is hard to verk in zese clozes. Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. Vee could do things you only dreamed of, Lebowski. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS! Wait in the car, Donny. That had not occurred to us, Dude.

JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! Look, Larry… Have you ever heard of Vietnam? Our basic freedoms. This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is—are you ready for this? —Arthur Digby Sellers. Mind if I smoke a jay? You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus! Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
